<h1>
	The birthday party for my friend <span class="name"Mike</span>
</h1>

<p>

My friend, <span class= "name">Mike</span>, had his birthday party at <span id="restaurant">McDonalds</span> with <span id="number">15 </span> other friends and their <span id= "companion">pets</span>. It was a <span id = "adjective">wild</span> party full of <span id="peopleAtCircus">dancing ladies</span>, <span id= "musicStyle">mariachi</span>music, playing <span id= "game">chess</span>, eating <span class = "desert">marshmallows</span>, and <span id= "typeOfSport">skydiving</span>. 
</p>

<p>
I hired a <span id="kindOfEmployee">clown</span> and a couple of <span id="twoMoreEmployees">singers </span> to entertain the friends, they put on a <span class = "size">big</span>show while dancing in <span id="typeOfClothing">swimsuits</span>, huge <span id="anotherTypeOfClothing">shoulder pads </span> and waving a <span id="sportsEquipment">baseball bat </span> around. 
</p>

<p>
<span class= "name">Mike</span> had a <span class="size">big</span> smile on his little face the whole time when he unwrapped his presents. He got a <span id = "musicalInstrument">guitar</span>, an <span id="thingMadeByApple">ipad</span> to help him <span id="hobby">play games</span>, books about <span id = "skillLearnedInCollege">how to cook a meal</span>, a new <span id="vehicle">bicycle</span>, several <span id="thingsYouBuyAtWalmart">toys</span> and even a life-sized <span id= "rideOnToy">truck</span> to ride around in our <span id="room">garage</span>. He even got cards that literally <span id= "action">blinked</span>, and one special card from his <span id= "relative"> cousing that said <span id="song">Baby Baby</span>. 
</p>

</p>
Then we took photos of Mike eating his <span id="food">pizza</span>, stuffing his face with <span class="desert">marshmallows</span>, his friend <span id= "movieStar">Tom Hanks</span> <span id="somethingYouDoOnSaturday">watching TV </span> and another friend, <span id= "anotherName">Tamy</span>, <span id= "partyActivity">texting on the phone</span>, I guess he had a little too much <span class="food">pizza</span>! Soon after the party was over, he felt <span id="feeling">euphoric</span>.  Let's do this again next year we all said.
